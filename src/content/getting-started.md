# Getting Started

## For Partners

We're looking for institutional partners who want early access and a voice in what gets built next. Partners get:

- **Early access** to new features and pipeline improvements
- **Roadmap commenting** — influence what gets prioritized
- **Direct support** during pilot deployments

You don't need to be an engineer to contribute. We need accessibility experts who can evaluate outputs, institutions willing to test the pipeline on real document collections, and practitioners who understand day-to-day remediation to help prioritize what matters most.

[Sign up for partner access](#/partner) or contact [Blake Bertuccelli-Booth](https://it.uic.edu/profiles/blake-bertuccelli-booth/) (b3b@uic.edu) directly.

## For WordPress Users

The Equalify Reflow for WordPress plugin connects your WordPress site to the converter API. Processed documents are served through a built-in viewer with table of contents, full-text search, and a link to download the original PDF.

Setup instructions will be available when the plugin is released publicly.

## For Developers

The source code is not yet publicly available. We are currently in Phase 1 (UIC pilot) and plan to open-source the full project under the AGPL license during Phase 3.

To stay informed about the public release, [sign up as a partner](#/partner).
